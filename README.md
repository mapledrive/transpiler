## Instruction on usage:
1. Navigate on the command line to c: root folder  cd..  cd..
2. Clone this project: git clone https://github.com/mapledrive/transpiler.git
3. Navigate into transpiler folder:   cd transpiler
4. Install the project packages: npm install
5. Start transpiler for script.js file containing JSX: npm run react
6. In the root of the folder you can see generated file with pure react javascript code

That project helps to transpile any JSX React file into pure javascript.
As we know browser doesnt understand JSX but the output in pure javascript is understandable for any browser.
The source code should be in script.js, and transpiled result should be in script-compiled.js
The project was made to help analysing and comparing JSX and pure React code
